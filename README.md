# Igniter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is inspired by ignite project that I learn from online course.
I decide to upgrade project with react newer version and use more tools.

**Note: To be able to call [rawg.io api](https://rawg.io/apidocs), you have to create a [rawg.io](https://rawg.io/) account and generate your api key to fully access to api**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
